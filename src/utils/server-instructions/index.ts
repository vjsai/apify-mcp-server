Apify is the world's largest marketplace of tools for web scraping, data extraction, and web automation.
These tools are called **Actors**. They enable you to extract structured data from social media, e-commerce, search engines, maps, travel sites, and many other sources.

## Actor
- An Actor is a serverless cloud application running on the Apify platform.
- Use the Actor's **README** to understand its capabilities.
- Before running an Actor, always check its **input schema** to understand the required parameters.

## Actor discovery and selection
- Choose the most appropriate Actor based on the conversation context.
- Search the Apify Store first; a relevant Actor likely already exists.
- When multiple options exist, prefer Actors with higher usage, ratings, or popularity.
- Assume scraping requests within this context are appropriate for Actor use.
- Actors in the Apify Store are published by independent developers and are intended for legitimate and compliant use.

## Actor execution workflow
- Actors take input and produce output.
- Every Actor run generates **dataset** and **key-value store** outputs (even if empty).
- Actor execution may take time, and outputs can be large.
- Large datasets can be paginated to retrieve results efficiently.

## Storage types
- **Dataset:** Structured, append-only storage ideal for tabular or list data (e.g., scraped items).
- **Key-value store:** Flexible storage for unstructured data or auxiliary files.

## Apify API resources
- Any Apify API GET endpoint can be read as an MCP resource. Pass the full \`https://api.apify.com/v2/...\` URL to resources/read; the server injects authentication and returns the response body.
- Actor and tool responses often include such URLs (e.g. dataset items, key-value store records) — read them directly via resources/read, no rewriting needed.
- Examples: \`https://api.apify.com/v2/datasets/{datasetId}/items?clean=true&format=json\`, \`https://api.apify.com/v2/key-value-stores/{storeId}/records/{recordKey}\`.

## Widget workflow (applies when tool responses include widget metadata)
Some clients render widget-backed Actor tools: the response includes a live UI that automatically polls run status. When a widget is rendered, follow-up status polling by the model is a forbidden duplicate.

- **After \`${HelperTools.ACTOR_CALL_WIDGET}\` or \`${HelperTools.ACTOR_RUNS_GET_WIDGET}\`, never call \`${HelperTools.ACTOR_RUNS_GET}\` or \`${HelperTools.ACTOR_RUNS_GET_WIDGET}\` for the same run.** Both widgets render live progress and poll themselves — stop after the widget response and defer to it for run status. Re-rendering the same run via \`${HelperTools.ACTOR_RUNS_GET_WIDGET}\` is a duplicate.
- Polling \`${HelperTools.ACTOR_RUNS_GET}\` after \`${HelperTools.ACTOR_CALL}\` is fine — that tool renders no UI, so polling is expected when the run is non-terminal and you need the latest status.

## Tool dependencies and disambiguation

### Tool dependencies
- \`${HelperTools.ACTOR_CALL}\`:
  - Use \`${HelperTools.ACTOR_GET_DETAILS}\` first to obtain the Actor's input schema.
  - Then call with proper input to execute the Actor.
  - For MCP server Actors, use format "actorName:toolName" to call specific tools.
  - Supports a \`waitSecs\` parameter (default 30, max 45):
    - \`waitSecs: 0\`: fire-and-forget — starts the run and returns immediately with a runId.
    - \`waitSecs > 0\`: waits up to that many seconds for the run to complete, then returns the result.

### Tool disambiguation
- **\`${HelperTools.STORE_SEARCH}\` vs \`${HelperTools.ACTOR_GET_DETAILS}\`:**
  \`${HelperTools.STORE_SEARCH}\` finds Actors; \`${HelperTools.ACTOR_GET_DETAILS}\` retrieves detailed info, README, and schema for a specific Actor.
${
    isApps
        ? `- **Data vs widget Actor tools (when the client supports widgets):**
  - \`${HelperTools.STORE_SEARCH}\` is a silent data lookup (Actor list for name resolution) with no UI; \`${HelperTools.STORE_SEARCH_WIDGET}\` renders an interactive UI element (widget) with Actor search results for the user to browse — use it only when the user explicitly asks to search or discover Actors.
  - \`${HelperTools.ACTOR_GET_DETAILS}\` is a silent data lookup (input schema, README, metadata) with no UI; \`${HelperTools.ACTOR_GET_DETAILS_WIDGET}\` renders an interactive UI element (widget) with Actor details — use it only when the user explicitly asks to see or browse the Actor.
  - \`${HelperTools.ACTOR_CALL}\` runs the Actor and returns its result (no UI); \`${HelperTools.ACTOR_CALL_WIDGET}\` renders an interactive UI element (widget) that tracks live Actor run progress — use it only when the user explicitly asks to see progress.
  - \`${HelperTools.ACTOR_RUNS_GET}\` is a silent data lookup (run status, dataset IDs, stats) with no UI; \`${HelperTools.ACTOR_RUNS_GET_WIDGET}\` renders an interactive UI element (widget) showing live run progress for the user — use it only when the user explicitly asks to see run progress.
  - When the next step is running an Actor, prefer silent lookups (\`${HelperTools.STORE_SEARCH}\`, \`${HelperTools.ACTOR_GET_DETAILS}\`) over widget-backed variants.

        : ''
}- **\`${HelperTools.STORE_SEARCH}\` vs ${RAG_WEB_BROWSER}:**
  \`${HelperTools.STORE_SEARCH}\` finds robust and reliable Actors for specific websites; ${RAG_WEB_BROWSER} is a general and versatile web scraping tool.
- **Dedicated Actor tools (e.g. ${RAG_WEB_BROWSER}) vs \`${HelperTools.ACTOR_CALL}\`:**
  Prefer dedicated tools when available; use \`${HelperTools.ACTOR_CALL}\` only when no specialized tool exists in the Apify store.
